API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, tools, and definitions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They enable the integration of different software systems, allowing them to work together and share data.

APIs can be used for various purposes, such as accessing web services, interacting with databases, or integrating third-party libraries. They provide a standardized way for developers to interact with the functionality of a system or service without having to understand its internal workings. APIs are crucial for building modern software applications, enabling them to connect with other services, devices, or platforms.
